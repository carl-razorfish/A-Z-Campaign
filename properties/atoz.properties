section_statement2=The fruit bag is just one of the ways we've added to our menu in the last few years. There is more to choose from than ever before, including porridge, Deli sandwiches, fruit bags, carrot sticks and salads – as well as our classics, such as the Big Mac.

category_tags=food
section_id=b-beef
section_img=img/b/main.jpg
section_statement1=People sometimes ask us where the beef in our burgers comes from and they're often surprised to find out that we get all of our beef from British and Irish cows – raised on farms like the one run by farmer Richard Hoskin.
section_statement2=Richard has supplied beef from the lovely Dorset countryside to McDonald's since 2005 and sometimes opens up his farm to show people where the beef for your Big Mac comes from. Like every single one of the 16,000 British and Irish beef farms we work with, Richard's farm meets the very strict, nationally-recognised animal welfare standards we expect from all our suppliers.
section_statement3=And what happens to beef once it gets to McDonald's? It's simple. We take the 100% whole cuts of quality beef, mince them, shape them, freeze them and cook them in our restaurants, so there is nothing added apart from a pinch of salt and pepper.
section_layout=layout-two-column
question_1=Is your beef fresh or frozen?
answer_1=Our beef patties are frozen instantly, after the beef has been ground, to make sure the very best quality and flavor is preserved. They are then transported in sealed, refrigerated trucks. To learn more, watch our beef video at Meet Our Suppliers.
question_2=What do you feed the cows that the beef comes from?
answer_2=McDonald's beef comes from cattle corn-fed in the U.S. Additionally, in order to keep up with demand, a small percentage of grass-fed beef is imported from Australia and New Zealand.
question_3=If your meat is of such high quality, why is it so cheap?
answer_3=At McDonald's, because we serve so many people each day, we are able to buy in bulk and then pass along the value to you. This enables us to offer our customers the best prices on the freshest, highest quality products.

section_statement1=We care about our planet, and our impact on the environment is something we try to keep to a minimum. This includes recycling and using recycled materials whenever we can in our restaurants and throughout our whole business. 
section_statement2=As well as 80% of our packaging being made from renewable resources, we recycle all the cardboard used in more than 90% of our restaurants. By finding greener ways to collect and dispose of our cardboard we prevent a whopping 11,500 tonnes from going to landfill each year.

section_statement2=Our people are keen to do their bit for the environment, so we've trained all our crew members on ways to save energy, for example putting equipment such as grills and toasters into the standby position when not in use. We've also introduced a module called Energy Efficiency into the McDonald's apprenticeship scheme which gives people tips and insights into how to be greener at work and at home.
section_statement3=And it's working! The small changes that our employees have made have meant we've reduced electricity use across our restaurants by over 5% - the equivalent to saving over 38,000 tonnes of CO2. We've also installed lots of energy saving technology in all our restaurants to help make things even more efficient, and in total we've reduced the amount of electricity we use by 14%.

section_statement1=We like happy hens and that's why we only use British free-range eggs across our whole menu.
section_statement2=Many of the farms that supply us with the more than 95 million eggs we need each year are small family-run businesses. One of these is the Lakes Free-Range Eggs Company in Cumbria, owned by David and Helen Brass. The Brass family farm has been supplying McDonald's since 2002 and is proud to be the only UK supplier to have received McDonald's Flagship Farm Status (link to FF page). Like us, David and Helen recognise that content hens lay great quality eggs and they do everything they can to keep their hens happy and healthy.
section_statement3=We're passionate about animal welfare and we were one of the first companies to make the switch to free-range eggs over 10 years ago. This has led to us being awarded the Good Egg Award from Compassion in World Farming and the RSPCA Good Business Award for three years running.

We do this by reducing, reusing and recycling whenever we can.
section_statement2=One way we do this is to recycle all our used cooking oil into biodiesel, which we use to fuel more than half of our delivery trucks. We won't bore you with the science, but it works a treat and it's good for the environment too!

section_statement2=In the build up to the Games we want to let people know about the important role British farmers play in events like this. We're inviting families and Olympic athletes to visit some of the 17,500 British and Irish farms that supply the ingredients for our menu and will also provide food for the London 2012 Olympic Games.

section_statement1=Do you know anyone that works at McDonald's? A lot of people have worked with us at some point, and our 85,000 UK employees have taken jobs at McDonald's for all sorts of different reasons. Often it's to earn some extra cash, or to have a flexible job that fits around study or childcare commitments. It might surprise you that around 2,000 people apply for a job at McDonald's every day.
section_statement2=Once people start working for McDonald's, they tend to stay because of the fun atmosphere and friends they make, and for the chance to progress within the company.
section_statement3=Many of our employees who stay with us want to get ahead – in fact 9 out of 10 of our restaurant managers have worked their way up from starting as crew members behind the counter. So we believe it's important to offer our employees a range of training opportunities, including the chance to gain a nationally recognised qualification while they work. Last year more than 12,000 McDonald's employees gained a qualification through work, such as an apprenticeship, a management diploma, or the foundation degree we offer to our restaurant managers.

section_statement2=The scheme's created close to 20,000 new football coaches since 2002, who've given more than a million young players free quality coaching. Over 400 of these qualified coaches are mums and women who have been trained through our Mums on the Ball campaign.

section_statement1=Jodie O'Neil is a crew trainer at one of our restaurants in Manchester, and she knows firsthand how important it is for people to have opportunities to learn and develop at work - she says working at McDonald's has given her options she didn't have before.
section_statement2=Jodie joined McDonald's in 2009 after a three week work trial as part of a nationwide scheme with job centres. As a mum to 4 children aged 7 to 17, Jodie's job at McDonald's has given her the chance to learn new skills, while juggling a busy family life. She'd never had the opportunity to get any formal qualifications before working at McDonald's, and jumped at the chance to become an apprentice. She was soon promoted to crew trainer and Jodie is now studying for her Level 3 Diploma in Shift Management.
section_statement3=Like Jodie, we believe there are lots more ways to keep learning than just at school, college or evening classes, so we give our people the chance to gain a wide range of nationally recognised qualifications while they work. Last year, more than 12,000 McDonald's employees gained a qualification at McDonald's, such as an adult certificate in maths or English, an apprenticeship in hospitality, a management diploma, right through to the foundation degree we offer to around 50 of our restaurant managers.
