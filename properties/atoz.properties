And you can find tasty slices of this variety of apple in some of our fruit bags thanks to the UK orchards that contribute towards the almost 100 tonnes of apples we use in a year during the English season.
section_statement2=The fruit bag is just one of the ways we've added to our Happy Meal menu in the last few years. There is more to choose from than ever before – from McNuggets to fish fingers, apples to carrot sticks, orange juice to organic milk, there's something for everyone. How about trying something new for your kids next time you visit us?

section_statement1=People sometimes ask us where the beef in our burgers comes from and they're often surprised to find out that we get all of our beef from British and Irish cows – raised on farms like the one run by farmer Richard Hoskin.
section_statement2=Richard has supplied beef from the lovely Dorset countryside to McDonald's since 2005 and sometimes opens up his farm to show people where the beef for your burgers comes from. Like every one of the more than 16,000 British and Irish beef farms we work with, Richard's farm meets the strict, nationally-recognised animal health and welfare standards we expect from all our suppliers.
section_statement3=And how do we make our burgers? It's simple. We take the 100% whole cuts of quality beef, mince them, shape them, freeze them and then cook them, so there is nothing added apart from a pinch of salt and pepper after cooking.

letter_img=img/e/letter.jpg
section_statement1=We employ 85,000 people in the UK, so if each of them works in a more energy-efficient way we can make a big difference!
section_statement2=Our people are keen to do their bit for the environment, so we've trained our crew members on ways to save energy, for example putting equipment such as grills and toasters into the standby position when not in use. We've also introduced a module called Energy Efficiency into the McDonald's Apprenticeship scheme which gives people tips and insights into how to be greener at work and at home.
section_statement3=Over 300 of our employees around the UK have volunteered to become Planet Champions – people who help raise awareness of ways to be more environmentally friendly in our restaurants. These Planet Champions encourage their colleagues to think about ways they can save energy every day, and are always on the lookout for new ideas on how to improve things even more.
section_statement4=And it's working! The small changes that our employees have made have reduced electricity use across our restaurants by over 5%. We've also installed lots of energy saving technologies in our restaurants to help make things even more efficient, so in total we reduced the underlying amount of electricity we used in 2010 by 14% compared with 2007 - the equivalent to saving over 42,000 tonnes of CO2.

section_statement1=We're passionate about animal welfare and that's why we only use British free-range eggs across our whole menu – including in our breakfasts, sauces and in the coatings for our chicken. 
section_statement2=Many of the farms that supply us with the more than 95 million eggs we need each year are small family-run businesses. One of these is the Lakes Free-Range Eggs Company in Cumbria, owned by David and Helen Brass. The Brass family farm has been supplying McDonald's since 2002 and their farm was the first in Britain to receive <a href="http://www.flagshipfarms.eu/" target="_blank">McDonald's Flagship Farm Status</a>. Like us, David and Helen recognise that content hens lay quality eggs and they do everything they can to keep their hens happy and healthy.
section_statement3=We're passionate about animal welfare and we were one of the first companies to make the switch to free-range eggs over 10 years ago. This has led to us being awarded the Good Egg Award from Compassion in World Farming and the RSPCA Good Business Award for three years running.

section_statement2=One way we do this is to recycle used cooking oil into bio-diesel, which we use to fuel more than half of our delivery trucks. We won't bore you with the science, but it works a treat! At the moment almost all of our restaurants recycle their oil to power our lorries.

section_statement2=In the build up to the London 2012 Olympic Games we want to let people know about the important role British farmers play in events like this. That's why we launched the Open Farms programme, which  throws open the gates to farms around the UK - inviting families and Olympic athletes to visit some of the 17,500 British and Irish farms that supply the ingredients for our menu and will also provide food for London 2012. <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/openfarms/application-form.mcd" target="_blank">Anyone can apply to visit a McDonald's farm</a> – do you fancy it?

section_statement1=Do you know anyone that works at McDonald's? A lot of people have worked with us at some point, and our 85,000 UK employees have taken jobs at McDonald's for all sorts of different reasons. It could be to earn some extra cash, or to have a flexible job that fits around study or childcare commitments. It might surprise you that around 2,000 people in the UK apply for a job at McDonald's every day.
section_statement2=Once people start working for McDonald's, they tend to stay because of the fun atmosphere and friends they make, and for the chance to progress within the company.
section_statement3=Many of our employees who stay with us want to get ahead – in fact 9 out of 10 of our restaurant managers have worked their way up from starting as crew members behind the counter. So we believe it's important to offer our employees a range of training opportunities, including the chance to gain a nationally recognised qualification while they work. Last year more than 12,000 McDonald's employees gained a qualification through work, such as an Apprenticeship in hospitality, a management diploma, or the Foundation Degree we offer to our restaurant managers.

Within six months she was promoted to shift manager and, although she also worked as a legal executive for a while, she quickly realised McDonald's offered the right that career path for her. Janette was a restaurant manager when, in 2010, she was given the opportunity to study for the Foundation Degree in Managing Business Operations. She jumped at the chance and become one of the first people to gain this qualification through McDonald's.
section_statement3=Like Janette, we believe there are lots more ways to keep learning than just at school, college or evening classes, so we give our people the chance to gain a wide range of nationally recognised qualifications while they work.

section_statement3=McDonald's supports Ronald McDonald House Charities, an independent charity which provides free ‘home away from home' accommodation for families with seriously ill children at hospitals across the UK, enabling families to stay close to their child and maintain a degree of normal family life.
section_statement4=The charity helps families like Vikki Chester-Walsh and her daughter Mollie. At three years old Mollie was diagnosed with a severe brain condition and was referred to a hospital hours away from her home for specialist treatment. When Mollie had her operation Vikki and the rest of her family stayed at the nearby Ronald McDonald House. Staying at the House meant they could focus all their efforts on providing comfort and care to Mollie when she needed it most, rather than worrying about where the family were going to sleep, shower and eat.
section_statement5=In the last 20 years 14 Ronald McDonald Houses have been built in the UK which, along with 29 sets of Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, provide families with over 400 bedrooms every single night of the year.

section_statement2=In fact, we were the first restaurant chain to start sending some of our restaurant waste that can't be recycled to special plants that turn it into energy – used to heat local houses or channelled into the National Grid. There are now almost 150 restaurants around the country sending all their waste to be converted into energy – preventing almost 15,000 tonnes of rubbish going to landfill every year.
section_statement3=And to reduce the amount of waste we produce in the first place, our employees are trained to make sure they waste as little as possible in restaurants.
