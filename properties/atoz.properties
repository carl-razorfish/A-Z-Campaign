section_statement2=The fruit bag is just one of the ways we've extended the choice on our Happy Meal menu in the last few years. From Chicken McNuggets to fish fingers, apples to carrot sticks and orange juice to organic milk, there's something for everyone.

section_statement1=People sometimes ask us where the beef in our burgers comes from, and many are pleased to hear that we get all of our beef from British and Irish farms, like the one run by farmer Richard Hoskin.
section_statement2=Richard has supplied beef from his farm in the Dorset countryside to McDonald's since 2005 and sometimes opens up his farm to show people where the beef for our burgers comes from. Richard's farm meets strict, nationally-recognised farm assurance scheme standards. These include standards on animal health and welfare, which we expect all our suppliers to meet.
section_statement3=And how do we make our burgers? Itâ€™s simple. We take the 100% whole cuts of beef, mince them, turn them into burgers, freeze them and then cook them. There's nothing added but a pinch of salt and pepper after cooking.

section_statement1=We employ 85,000 people in the UK, so if each of them works in a more energy-efficient way we have the opportunity to make a big difference.
section_statement2=Our people are keen to do their bit for the environment, so we've trained our crew members in ways to save energy, for example putting equipment such as grills and toasters into the standby position when not in use. We've also introduced a module called Energy Efficiency into the McDonald's Apprenticeship scheme which gives people tips on how to be more environmentally friendly at work and at home. 
section_statement3=Over 300 of our employees around the UK have volunteered to become Planet Champions - people who help raise awareness of ways to be more environmentally friendly in our restaurants. These Planet Champions encourage their colleagues to think about ways they can save energy every day, and are always on the lookout for new ideas on how to improve things even more.
section_statement4=And it's working. The small changes that our employees have made have reduced electricity use across our restaurants by over 5%. We've also installed lots of energy saving technologies in our restaurants to help make things run even more efficiently, so in total we reduced the underlying amount of electricity we used in 2010 by 14% compared with 2007 - the equivalent to saving over 42,000 tonnes of CO2.

section_statement1=We're passionate about animal welfare and that's why we only use free-range eggs across our whole menu - even in our sauces and the coating on our Chicken McNuggets. 
section_statement2=We use more than 95 million eggs every year, and one of the British farms that helps provide these is the Lakes Free-Range Eggs Company in Cumbria, owned by David and Helen Brass. The Brass family farm has been supplying McDonald's since 2002 and their farm was the first in Britain to receive <a href="http://www.flagshipfarms.eu/" target="_blank" rel="external">McDonald's Flagship Farm Status</a>. Like us, David and Helen recognise that contented hens lay quality eggs and they do everything they can to improve the environment of their hens.
section_statement3=We were one of the first companies to make the switch to free-range eggs over 10 years ago and this has led to us being awarded the Good Egg Award from Compassion in World Farming and three RSPCA Good Business Awards.

section_statement2=One way we do this is to recycle used cooking oil into bio-diesel, which we use to fuel more than half of our delivery trucks. Almost all of our restaurants recycle their cooking oil in this way, and those that can't at the moment are working hard to make it possible - for example our restaurants in Northern Ireland plan to be able to convert their oil by the end of 2012.

All the farms that supply us are part of nationally-recognised farm assurance schemes, which include standards on animal health and welfare, and we're proud to hold long-term relationships with many of our suppliers.
section_statement2=Through our <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/openfarms/" target="_blank">Open Farms programme</a>, we want to celebrate the farmers who make such a big contribution to McDonald's menu - letting people know about the important role British agriculture plays in their McDonald's meal. The Open Farms programme opens the gates to farms around the UK - inviting families and Olympic athletes to visit some of the British and Irish farms that provide ingredients for our menu and will also provide food for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
section_statement3=Richard Hoskin, who has supplied us with beef from his farm in the Dorset countryside since 2005, hosted the very first Open Farms visit last year.

section_statement1=It might surprise you to know that around 2,000 people apply for a job at McDonald's every day. And since 2009 we've created more than 11,000 new jobs across the UK.
section_statement2=Do you know anyone who works at McDonald's? A lot of people have worked with us at some point, and our 85,000 UK employees have taken jobs at McDonald's for all sorts of different reasons. It could be to earn some extra cash, or to have flexibility around study or childcare commitments. 
section_statement3=Many of our employees want to get ahead - 9 out of 10 of our restaurant managers and 1 in 5 of our franchisees started out as crew members behind the counter or in the kitchens. And over half the UK Executive Board began their careers working in our restaurants. So we believe itâ€™s important to offer our employees a range of training opportunities, including the chance to gain a nationally recognised qualification while they work - such as an Apprenticeship in Hospitality, a management diploma, or the Foundation Degree we offer to our restaurant managers.

Within six months she was promoted to shift manager and, although she also worked as a legal executive for a while, she quickly realised McDonaldâ€™s offered the right that career path for her.

It's an independent charity providing free 'home away from home' accommodation for families with seriously ill children at hospitals across the UK, enabling families to stay close to their child and maintain a degree of normal family life.
section_statement2=Every year, McDonald's customers raise millions of pounds for Ronald McDonald House Charities just by donating their change in the charity boxes by the tills in McDonald's restaurants. 
section_statement3=The charity helps families like Vikki Chester-Walsh and her daughter Mollie. At three years old Mollie was diagnosed with a severe brain condition and was referred to a hospital many hours away from her home for specialist treatment. When Mollie had her operation Vikki and the rest of her family stayed at the nearby Ronald McDonald House. Staying at the House meant they could focus all their efforts on providing comfort and care to Mollie when she needed it most, rather than worrying about where the family were going to sleep, shower and eat.
section_statement4=In the last 20 years 14 Ronald McDonald Houses have been built in the UK which, along with 29 sets of Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, provide families with over 400 bedrooms every single night of the year.
