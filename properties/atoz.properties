section_statement1=We employ over 85,000 people in the UK, so if each of them works in a more energy-efficient way we have the opportunity to make a big difference. 
section_statement2=Our people are keen to do their bit for the environment, so we've trained our crew members in ways to save energy. For example, putting equipment such as grills and toasters into the standby position when not in use. We've also introduced a module called Energy Efficiency into the McDonald's Apprenticeship scheme which gives people tips on how to be more environmentally friendly at work and at home. 
section_statement3=Over 565 of our employees around the UK have volunteered to become Planet Champions – people who help to raise awareness of ways to be more environmentally friendly in our restaurants. These Planet Champions encourage their colleagues to think about ways they can save energy every day and are always on the lookout for new ideas on how to improve things even more. 
section_statement4=Across all of our restaurants, the small changes our employees have made are paying off. In addition we've installed lots of energy saving technologies in our restaurants to help make things run even more efficiently. We reduced the total amount of electricity used in 2010 compared to 2007, despite serving nearly 20% more customers.

One of our suppliers that helped provide these is the Lakes Free-Range Eggs Company in Cumbria, owned by David and Helen Brass. The Brass family has been supplying McDonald's since 2002. Like us, David and Helen recognise that contented hens lay quality eggs and have improved the environment for their hens. 
section_statement3=We were one of the first companies to make the switch to free-range eggs over 10 years ago and this has led to us being awarded the Good Egg Award from Compassion in World Farming and three RSPCA Good Business Awards.

section_statement2=One way we do this is to recycle used cooking oil into bio-diesel, which we use to fuel more than half of our delivery trucks. 97% of our restaurants recycle their cooking oil in this way, and those that can't at the moment are working hard to make it possible – for example our restaurants in Northern Ireland plan to be able to recycle their oil by the end of 2012.

section_statement1=Last year, more than 10,000 of our employees gained a qualification while working at McDonald's. These included adult certificates in maths and English, apprenticeships in Hospitality and Catering, right through to the Foundation Degrees we offer our restaurant managers each year. These qualifications are nationally recognised. We're also inspected by Ofsted just like any school or college. 
section_statement2=Janette Moran is a McDonald's restaurant manager in Manchester, and she knows first-hand how important it is for people to have opportunities to learn and develop at work.
section_statement3=Janette joined McDonald's as a part-time crew member in 1997 to help fund her college studies. Within six months she was promoted to shift manager and, although she also worked as a legal executive for a while, she quickly realised McDonald's offered the right career path for her. Janette was a restaurant manager when, in 2010 , she was given the opportunity to study for the Foundation Degree in Managing Business Operations. She jumped at the chance and became one of the first people to gain this qualification through McDonald's.

section_statement1=Ronald McDonald House Charities has been McDonald's charity of choice for over 20 years. It's an independent charity that looks after families with children in hospitals across the UK, by providing free 'home away from home' accommodation just a stone's throw from the children's ward. Every year, McDonald's customers raise millions of pounds for Ronald McDonald House Charities just by donating their change in the charity boxes by the tills in McDonald's restaurants.
section_statement2= The charity helps families like Vikki Chester-Walsh and her daughter Mollie. At three years old Mollie was diagnosed with a severe brain condition and was referred to a hospital many hours away from her home for specialist treatment. When Mollie had her operation, Vikki and the rest of her family stayed in the nearby Ronald McDonald House. Staying at the House meant they could focus all their efforts on providing comfort and care to Mollie when she needed it most, rather than worrying about where the family are going to sleep, shower and eat.  
section_statement3=In the last 20 years, 14 Ronald McDonald Houses have been built in the UK, along with over 25 sets of Ronald McDonald Family Rooms – in total that's 400 rooms for families every night of the year. But there are still a lot of families that need the help of Ronald McDonald House Charities.
