					<p>Richard has supplied beef from his farm in the Dorset countryside to McDonald's since 2005 and sometimes opens up his farm to show people where the beef for our burgers comes from. Richard's farm meets strict, nationally-recognised farm assurance scheme standards. These include standards on animal health and welfare, which we expect all our suppliers to meet.</p>
					<p>And how do we make our burgers? It’s simple. We take the 100% whole cuts of beef, mince them, turn them into burgers, freeze them and then cook them. There's nothing added but a pinch of salt and pepper after cooking.</p>

					<p>Our people are keen to do their bit for the environment, so we've trained our crew members in ways to save energy, for example putting equipment such as grills and toasters into the standby position when not in use. We've also introduced a module called Energy Efficiency into the McDonald's Apprenticeship scheme which gives people tips on how to be more environmentally friendly at work and at home.</p>
					<p>Over 300 of our employees around the UK have volunteered to become Planet Champions - people who help raise awareness of ways to be more environmentally friendly in our restaurants. These Planet Champions encourage their colleagues to think about ways they can save energy every day, and are always on the lookout for new ideas on how to improve things even more.</p>
					<p>And it's working. The small changes that our employees have made have reduced electricity use across our restaurants by over 5%. We've also installed lots of energy saving technologies in our restaurants to help make things run even more efficiently, so in total we reduced the underlying amount of electricity we used in 2010 by 14% compared with 2007 - the equivalent to saving over 42,000 tonnes of CO2.</p>

The Open Farms programme opens the gates to farms around the UK - inviting families and Olympic athletes to visit some of the British and Irish farms that provide ingredients for our menu and will also provide food for the London 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
					<p>Richard Hoskin, who has supplied us with beef from his farm in the Dorset countryside since 2005, hosted the very first Open Farms visit last year.

					<p>Do you know anyone who works at McDonald's? A lot of people have worked with us at some point, and our 85,000 UK employees have taken jobs at McDonald's for all sorts of different reasons. It could be to earn some extra cash, or to have flexibility around study or childcare commitments.</p>
					<p>Many of our employees want to get ahead - 9 out of 10 of our restaurant managers and 1 in 5 of our franchisees started out as crew members behind the counter or in the kitchens. And over half the UK Executive Board began their careers working in our restaurants. So we believe it’s important to offer our employees a range of training opportunities, including the chance to gain a nationally recognised qualification while they work - such as an Apprenticeship in Hospitality, a management diploma, or the Foundation Degree we offer to our restaurant managers.</p>

					<p>So far the scheme has led to 20,000 new football coaches being trained since 2002, who've given more than a million young players free coaching. Over 400 of these qualified coaches are mums and women who have been trained through our 'Mums on the Ball' campaign.</p>

					<p class="first">No one likes to see litter, but unfortunately it's out there. We take great pride in our local environment and that’s why we've been working hard for more than 20 years to try and reduce the amount of litter on our streets.</p>
					<p>We were the first restaurant company to introduce litter patrols in the UK - employees going out every day to collect local litter, not just McDonald's packaging, that's been dropped around the restaurant.</p>
					<p>We're also partnering with Keep Britain Tidy on the new "Love Where You Live" campaign, which aims to encourage people to stop dropping litter on the street. There will be plenty of chances for our employees and customers to get involved in events and activities to help us tidy up our local communities - helping everyone really love where they live. Find out how you can do your bit by visiting "Love Where You Live" on Facebook.</p>

					<p class="first">Last year, more than 10,000 of our employees gained a qualification while working at McDonald's – including adult certificates in Maths or English, Apprenticeships in Hospitality and Level 3 Diplomas in Shift Management, right through to the Foundation Degrees we offer to around 50 of our restaurant managers each year. These qualifications are nationally recognised and we're inspected by the exam regulator Ofsted just like any school or college.</p>
					<p>Janette Moran is a McDonald's restaurant manager in Manchester, and she knows firsthand how important it is for people to have opportunities to learn and develop at work – in fact she was one of our first managers to gain the Foundation Degree.</p>
					<p>Janette joined McDonald's as a part-time crew member in 1997 to help fund her college studies. Within six months she was promoted to shift manager and, although she also worked as a legal executive for a while, she quickly realised McDonald’s offered the right that career path for her. Janette was a restaurant manager when, in 2010, she was given the opportunity to study for the Foundation Degree in Managing Business Operations. She jumped at the chance and became one of the first people to gain this qualification through McDonald's.</p>
					<p>Like Janette, we believe there are lots more ways to keep learning than just at school, college or evening classes, and that’s why we give our people the chance to gain a wide range of qualifications while they work.</p>

					<p class="first">Ronald McDonald House Charities has been McDonald’s charity of choice for over 20 years. It's an independent charity providing free 'home away from home' accommodation for families with seriously ill children at hospitals across the UK, enabling families to stay close to their child and maintain a degree of normal family life.</p>
					<p>Every year, McDonald's customers raise millions of pounds for Ronald McDonald House Charities just by donating their change in the charity boxes by the tills in McDonald's restaurants.</p>
					<p>The charity helps families like Vikki Chester-Walsh and her daughter Mollie. At three years old Mollie was diagnosed with a severe brain condition and was referred to a hospital many hours away from her home for specialist treatment. When Mollie had her operation Vikki and the rest of her family stayed at the nearby Ronald McDonald House. Staying at the House meant they could focus all their efforts on providing comfort and care to Mollie when she needed it most, rather than worrying about where the family were going to sleep, shower and eat.</p>
					<p>In the last 20 years 14 Ronald McDonald Houses have been built in the UK which, along with 29 sets of Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, provide families with over 400 bedrooms every single night of the year. But there are still a lot of families that need the help of Ronald McDonald House Charities. To find out more about where the money donated every day goes, visit the <a href="http://www.rmhc.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ronald McDonald House Charities website</a>.</p>

					<p>We have a long-term partnership with the Food Animal Initiative, a farming enterprise near Oxford that runs projects to improve animal welfare standards and trial new farming methods that help British farmers look after the countryside in a more sustainable way. This includes working with them to find ways to improve the environment of free-range egg laying hens - such as planting trees to provide more cover, creating conditions similar to their natural habitat.</p>
					<p>We were also one of the first companies to make the switch to free-range eggs over 10 years ago and we're very proud to have also been awarded the Good Egg Award from Compassion in World Farming for our work in this area.</p>

					<p class="first">We believe it's important for everyone to help protect and preserve the environment for future generations, and our ambition is simple: to reduce the impact we have on the environment across the whole of our business. Part of this means working towards sending no waste to landfill whatsoever and continuing to find ways to reduce, reuse and recycle.</p>
					<p>In fact, we were the first restaurant chain to start sending some of our restaurant waste that can't be recycled to special plants that turn it into energy - used to heat local houses or channelled into the National Grid. There are now almost 150 restaurants around the country sending all their waste to be converted into energy – preventing almost 15,000 tonnes of rubbish going to landfill every year.</p>
					<p>And to reduce the amount of waste we produce in the first place, our employees are trained to make sure they waste as little as possible in restaurants. Plus we track the food we sell throughout the day, so we only order and prepare the right amount.</p>
